# Optimized-Sieve-of-Eratosthenes
A simple yet very fast optimized version at bit-level of the Sieve of Eratosthene to find and count primes numbers up to 1_000_000_000 and more in theory in a few seconds.

## Test
(Version 1): Without logs, the program found 455052511 primes from 2 to 10_000_000_000 in 30.887541 seconds with a 596 MB cache on an Intel i7.
